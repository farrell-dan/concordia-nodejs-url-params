## Setup

Today's workshop is a _**full stack**_ workshop. You'll need 2 active terminals to be able to run this workshop as intended.

### The Frontend (website):
1. Open a terminal.
2. Navigate to the `client` folder by typing `cd client`.
3. Install the dependencies with `yarn install`.
4. Boot React with `yarn start`.

### The Backend (server):
1. Open a **new** terminal (you can use a split terminal if you want).
2. Navigate to the `server` folder by typing `cd server`.
3. Install the dependencies with `yarn install`.
4. Boot the server with `yarn start:server`.

After following these steps, you should have 2 terminals. One should be running React, and the other should be running the server.
